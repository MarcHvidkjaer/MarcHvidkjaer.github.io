I made this website from scratch, using ChatGPT and Hugo. To edit the site, I use VScode. I made this site from scratch as I wanted a minimal site with a two column setup and a top menu bar. The closest thing that emulated minimalism was the Academimal theme by [Lei Yang]([url](https://github.com/yangl1996/homepage)). Yang had the helpful advice to _not_ fork his site, but instead understanding how Hugo works and build a site yourself. This was good advice. This made me develop a website which I have full control over. 

Some to do's for the site
- Make it mobile compatible
- Put the research page dropdowns (details) on the same line as the article
