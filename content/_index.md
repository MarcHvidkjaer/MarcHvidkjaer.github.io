I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Government at Harvard University. My research interests lie broadly in Comparative Political Economy and Political Behavior. I am mainly interested in the politics of inequality and welfare state development in advanced capitalistic democracies. At Harvard, I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a> and the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/">Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies</a>.</p>

Before coming to Harvard, I received my BSc and MSc in Political Science (<em>Statskundskab</em>) at the University of Copenhagen. While studying, I taught Quantitative Methods and Comparative Politics, worked as a research assistant at Aarhus University, and worked in consulting. I regularly contribute to the leading national newspapers in Denmark, where a list of my writings can be seen on my <a href="http://localhost:1313/pages/media/">media page</a>.</p>

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis and cooking. I hold three passports, and I used one of them to become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Men%27s_Junior_World_Handball_Championship">second best handball goalkeeper on the second worst team in the world</a>. If you want to play tennis, discuss research or anything else, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!</p>
